The Firestore is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that lets you store and sync data between your users in realtime. We can structure data in our ways to improve querying and fetching capabilities. So in the tutorial, I introduce how to build an “Angular 10 CRUD Firestore Example” project with the help of @angular/fire lib to do CRUD operation: POST/GET/PUT/DELETE queries with step by step coding examples.
