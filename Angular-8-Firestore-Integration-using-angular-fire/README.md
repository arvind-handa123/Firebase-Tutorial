Firestore is a NoSQL document database built for automatic scaling, high performance, and ease of application development. It supports offline mode so our app will work fine (write, read, listen to, and query data) whether device has internet connection or not, it automatically fetches changes from our database to Firebase Server. So In the tutorial, I introduce an example “Integrate Angular 8 Firestore using @angular/fire”.

– I draw overview diagram architecture of our system.
– Create a Firebase account and setup Cloud Firestore.
– Setup an Angular WebApp that integrate with Firestore.
