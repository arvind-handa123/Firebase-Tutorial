The Firestore is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that lets you store and sync data between your users in realtime. We can structure data in our ways to improve querying and fetching capabilities. So in the tutorial, I introduce how to build an “Angular 9 CRUD Firestore Example” project with the help of @angular/fire lib to do CRUD operation: POST/GET/PUT/DELETE queries with step by step coding examples.

– I draw a fullstack overview diagram architecture from Angular frontend to Cloud Firestore.
– I illustrate details about @angular/fire CRUD operations.
– I implement Angular 9 CRUD application with the @angular/fire lib to do CRUD queries (Post/Get/Put/Delete document) to Cloud Firestore.
